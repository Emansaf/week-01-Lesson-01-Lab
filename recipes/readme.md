She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list for How to make and an unordered list for ingredients).

Task 3 : MORE CSS
========================

Grandma is pretty happy, but we can do better:

1. Grandma's recipe needs more work so open the the index.html and the styles.css files in VScode.
1. Style the link color as chocolate
1. The body needs 20px of space between the border and the text.
1. Change the h1 to 40px and center align it.
1. Select just the words: "MMMMMM COOKIES!!!!" in the Nutrition Information and make them bold
1. **BONUS Can you make more of the html background-color show around the outside of the body border?
